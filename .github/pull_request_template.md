## Root cause
<!--
Use this section for bug fixes, regressions, and security patches.
If there is no defect root cause (feature/docs/chore/refactor), rename this heading to "## Context" or "## Goal".
Do not leave placeholder bullets. Replace with 1-3 concrete bullets.
-->
<!-- Add concrete bullets here. -->

## Changes
<!-- Add concrete change bullets grouped by scope (files/modules/behavior). -->

## Validation
<!-- List exact commands run and outcome (or explicitly "not run" with reason). -->

## Risks and follow-ups (optional)
<!-- Optional. Remove this section if there are no meaningful risks/follow-ups. -->

---

Formatting notes:
- Keep sections readable markdown (real line breaks, no escaped `\n` in raw text).
- Prefer short, factual bullets with concrete scope (files, behavior, boundaries).
- Keep validation honest: commands run, manual checks, or "not run" with reason.

See `docs/pull-request-guidelines.md` for detailed examples by PR type.
