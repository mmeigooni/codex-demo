Formatting notes:
- Keep sections readable markdown (real line breaks, no escaped `\n` in raw text).
- Prefer short, factual bullets with concrete scope (files, behavior, boundaries).
- Keep validation honest: commands run, manual checks, or "not run" with reason.

See `docs/pull-request-guidelines.md` for detailed examples by PR type.
