# Story Mode Judge Scorecard

## Purpose
Provide a fast rubric to evaluate the demo on clarity, utility, novelty, and reliability with concrete evidence links.

## Scoring Scale
- `1`: weak / unclear
- `2`: partial
- `3`: strong
- `4`: exceptional

## Rubric

| Axis | Weight | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Clarity | 30% | Narrative unclear | Some concepts clear | Clear phases and rationale | Exceptional story + technical clarity |
| Utility | 30% | Mostly visual | Some practical value | Measurable reviewer usefulness | Clear productivity gains under pressure |
| Novelty | 20% | Familiar UI | Mildly distinct | Distinct memory narrative framing | Standout creative + technical framing |
| Reliability | 20% | Fragile demo | Occasional variance | Stable with fallback path | Stable, repeatable, and auditable |

## Evidence Mapping

| Claim | Artifact | Pass Condition |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Story Mode is optional and non-blocking | Top bar screenshot + session clip | Toggle on/off does not break run flow |
| Runtime phases remain useful and legible | Runtime phase bar captures | Utility + story framing both visible |
| Salience guidance is actionable | Results panel screenshot + narration line | "Why this memory matters" shown and explained |
| Context cues improve interpretation | PR context panel screenshot | Tagged title displays cues without clutter |
| Deep context remains accessible | Details drawer screenshot set | Evidence/Episodes/Index/Cortex Record shown |
| Reliability under variance | Rehearsal evidence log entries | Fallback path handled with recorded run IDs |
